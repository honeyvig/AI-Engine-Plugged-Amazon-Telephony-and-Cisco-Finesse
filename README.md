# AI-Engine-Plugged-Amazon-Telephony-and-Cisco-Finesse
We have a threat detection engine the assess audio for fintech companies. We're looking to plug our engine into telecom platforms like AWS Telephony, Cisco Finesse, etc.
=====================================
To integrate a threat detection engine for fintech companies into telecom platforms like AWS Telephony and Cisco Finesse, you can create a Python-based solution that listens for audio streams, processes them, and interacts with these telecom platforms. This integration will typically involve the following steps:

    Listening to Audio Streams from Telecom Platforms: You'll need to connect to the platforms like AWS Telephony or Cisco Finesse to listen for incoming audio streams (e.g., phone calls or voice interactions).

    Audio Processing and Threat Detection: Your threat detection engine will analyze the audio to detect threats (e.g., fraudulent or malicious speech).

    Triggering Alerts or Actions: If a threat is detected, your system should trigger an alert or take appropriate actions, like logging the event or notifying security personnel.

Hereâ€™s a basic Python code outline for integrating with AWS and Cisco platforms:
Prerequisites:

    Install necessary libraries for AWS and Cisco APIs.
        For AWS: boto3, requests, pyaudio
        For Cisco Finesse: requests (to interact with Cisco APIs)
        Audio processing libraries like numpy, scipy, or your custom threat detection engine.

Example Code for Integration with AWS Telephony:

import boto3
import pyaudio
import wave
import threading
import requests
import json

# Initialize AWS SDK for telephony interaction
aws_client = boto3.client('connect', region_name='us-west-2')

# Initialize PyAudio for audio capture (this could be a live stream or file)
p = pyaudio.PyAudio()

# Function to handle audio stream and detect threats
def detect_threat_from_audio(audio_stream):
    # Assuming you have a threat detection engine, replace this with actual logic
    threat_detected = False
    
    # Example of processing audio, replace with your engine
    if len(audio_stream) > 5000:  # Dummy condition for detection
        threat_detected = True

    if threat_detected:
        trigger_alert()

# Function to simulate an incoming call and process audio
def simulate_incoming_call():
    # Simulate a stream of audio (In real case, you will use a live feed from AWS telephony platform)
    audio_stream = []  # Replace with real-time audio stream
    detect_threat_from_audio(audio_stream)

# Trigger an alert if threat detected
def trigger_alert():
    alert_data = {
        "message": "Threat detected in the audio stream!",
        "timestamp": "2024-12-16T12:00:00",
        "severity": "High"
    }

    # Send an alert via HTTP to a monitoring system (e.g., to your security platform)
    response = requests.post("https://your-alerting-system.com/alerts", json=alert_data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Alert triggered successfully.")
    else:
        print("Failed to trigger alert.")

# Function to connect and listen for calls from AWS Telephony
def connect_to_aws_telephony():
    # This example assumes you have an AWS Connect instance configured
    # Replace 'your_instance_id' with your actual AWS Connect instance ID
    instance_id = 'your_instance_id'
    
    # Poll for active calls or events from AWS Telephony
    response = aws_client.list_queues(InstanceId=instance_id)
    
    if response['QueueSummaryList']:
        # Simulate receiving audio data for each call
        for queue in response['QueueSummaryList']:
            print(f"Monitoring queue: {queue['Name']}")
            # Process audio from this call
            simulate_incoming_call()

# Main function to start integration
def main():
    # Start listening to AWS Telephony for calls
    threading.Thread(target=connect_to_aws_telephony).start()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Steps in the Code:

    AWS Telephony Integration (AWS Connect):
        boto3.client('connect') is used to connect to the AWS Telephony API.
        We simulate incoming calls using list_queues, though you can modify this based on your specific use case.

    Audio Stream Handling (Using PyAudio):
        PyAudio is used for audio capturing (replace with real audio data from the telecom platform).
        The detect_threat_from_audio function handles the stream and checks for potential threats. This function is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual threat detection logic.

    Trigger Alerts on Threat Detection:
        Once a threat is detected, an HTTP POST request is made to an alerting system. This can be modified to trigger any kind of alerting mechanism (e.g., sending an email, logging to a security dashboard, etc.).

    Threat Detection Engine:
        The detect_threat_from_audio function can be replaced with your custom logic to process audio and detect threats (e.g., using AI/ML models for fraud detection or analyzing speech patterns).

Example Code for Integration with Cisco Finesse:

If you're using Cisco Finesse, you would interact with their REST APIs to fetch call details and listen for audio.

import requests

# Function to get active calls from Cisco Finesse
def get_active_calls_from_cisco():
    finesse_api_url = "https://your-cisco-finesse-instance/api/endpoint"
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer your_access_token',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }

    # Fetch active calls
    response = requests.get(finesse_api_url, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        active_calls = response.json()
        for call in active_calls:
            print(f"Processing call with ID: {call['id']}")
            # Process the call's audio data (this would depend on how Cisco Finesse streams audio)
            simulate_incoming_call()
    else:
        print("Error fetching active calls from Cisco Finesse.")

# Main function to connect to Cisco Finesse
def main():
    get_active_calls_from_cisco()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Explanation:

    The above code assumes you're fetching active call details from Cisco Finesse via their API and processing the audio.
    You'll need the correct authorization tokens and API endpoint from Cisco to interact with their system.

Final Integration Considerations:

    API Authentication: Make sure to handle API authentication securely, such as using OAuth tokens for AWS and Cisco services.
    Audio Stream Handling: Depending on your telephony provider, you may receive audio streams in different formats (e.g., PCM, MP3). You'll need to adjust how you handle these streams for threat detection.
    Real-Time Processing: For production environments, ensure that the system can handle real-time processing, especially if you're dealing with high volumes of incoming calls.
    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to deal with potential API failures or timeouts when connecting to telecom platforms.

This basic code can be expanded and customized based on the specifics of your threat detection engine and the platforms you're integrating with.
